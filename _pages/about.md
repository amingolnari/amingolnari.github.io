My passion for AI-driven solutions has been a driving force throughout my journey, with a particular focus on exploring the frontiers of **Autonomous Driving**. This enthusiasm has only deepened as I continue to expand my knowledge across diverse domains of **Machine Vision** and **Deep Learning**.

My interest in these fields was further nurtured during my collaboration with **Shahrood University**â€™s Digital Signal Processing Laboratory, where I delved into **Deep Learning**, **Machine Vision**, and **Signal Processing**. I also contributed to cutting-edge research in **Medical Imaging**, analyzing fMRI and res-fMRI data using advanced machine learning techniques. These experiences not only enriched my expertise in deep learning applications for healthcare and **Computational Neuroscience** but also reinforced my ability to tackle complex, interdisciplinary challenges.

## Research Interests

- **Deep Learning** and its applications have been central to my research
- **Machine Vision** and its applications in neuroscience, AR, and autonomous driving
- **Autonomous Robots** and AI-driven control systems
- **Neuroimaging** neuroplasticity and spatial-attention patterns, MRI, fMRI, and medical signals
- **Control & Electrical Engineering** in general


While I am deeply motivated by the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare and other domains, I am equally eager to explore the exciting field of Autonomous Driving, alongside advancing my expertise in Deep Learning. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and to contribute to cutting-edge research, particularly in **deep learning**, **computational neuroscience**, and **machine vision**. Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, humility, and the desire to constantly learn and improve. You can find more about my work on GitHub, ResearchGate, and LinkedIn.
