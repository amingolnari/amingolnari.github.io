I am a passionate and dedicated Machine Learning Specialist with over four years of experience in data science and more than a decade in electrical engineering. My academic journey began with a **Master's in Electrical Engineering** from Shahrood University of Technology, where I focused on **telecommunications systems** and developed an augmented reality-based face detection system for my dissertation. During this time, I honed my skills in **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **MATLAB**, which laid the foundation for my subsequent work in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

My interest in AI-driven solutions further evolved during my collaboration with **Shahrood University’s Digital Signal Processing Laboratory**, where I worked on machine vision, signal processing, and generative models. I then contributed to research on **neuroplasticity** and in general, **Medical Imaging** at Ruhr-University Bochum’s **Biopsychology Laboratory**, exploring fMRI & rs-fMRI data using advanced machine learning techniques. These experiences enriched my expertise in deep learning applications for healthcare and neuroscience.

I am particularly drawn to research that pushes the boundaries of AI in medical and computational neuroscience applications. This has led me to contribute to projects like **Adaptive Real-Time Multi-Loss Function Optimization** for **cancer segmentation** and **brain tumor segmentation** using attention-based models.

## Research Interests

- **Deep Learning** for medical imaging and computational neuroscience
- **Machine Vision** and its applications in augmented reality
- **Neuroplasticity** and spatial-attention patterns through neuroimaging
- **Autonomous Robots** and AI-driven control systems
- **Multi-objective optimization** in deep learning, particularly in medical datasets

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB, C/C++, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, OpenCL
- **Software & Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX, Microsoft Visio, Word, PowerPoint
- **Technical Expertise**: 
  - Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision
  - Medical Imaging Analysis and Segmentation
  - Signal Processing and Neuroimaging (fMRI, LFP analysis)
  - Generative Models and One-shot Learning
  - Control Systems Engineering (Siemens PLCs, LOGO programming)

I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and to contribute to cutting-edge research, particularly in **deep learning**, **computational neuroscience**, and **machine vision**. Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, humility, and the desire to constantly learn and improve.
