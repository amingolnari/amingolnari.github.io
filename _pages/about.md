My interest in AI-driven solutions further evolved during my collaboration with **Shahrood Universityâ€™s Digital Signal Processing Laboratory**, where I worked on **Deep Learning**, **Machine Vision**, and **Signal Processing**. I then contributed to research on **Medical Imaging** exploring fMRI & res-fMRI data using advanced machine learning techniques. These experiences enriched my expertise in deep learning applications for healthcare and computational neuroscience.

Motivated by the transformative potential of **machine learning** in **healthcare**, I leverage my strong foundation in machine learning to contribute to this field. Over the past year, I have been honing my expertise in this field, combining creativity with a passion for solving complex challenges. My dedication to research, combined with my collaborative mindset and interdisciplinary background, allows me to bring both technical depth and innovative problem-solving to impactful research projects.
