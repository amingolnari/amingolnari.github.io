<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am a passionate and dedicated Machine Learning Specialist with over four years of experience in data science and more than a decade in Electrical Engineering. I obtained my Master's in **Electrical Engineering** with a specialization in **Telecommunications Systems** from the **Shahrood University of Technology**. During my studies, I developed an augmented reality-based face detection system for my dissertation, where I applied advanced techniques in **computer vision** and **deep learning**. This work deepened my research and development skills, particularly in AI-driven solutions, and fostered my passion for tackling complex technical challenges. During this time, I honed my skills in **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **MATLAB**, which laid the foundation for my subsequent work in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

My interest in AI-driven solutions further evolved during my collaboration with **Shahrood University’s Digital Signal Processing Laboratory**, where I worked on machine vision, signal processing, and generative models. I then contributed to research on **Medical Imaging** at Ruhr-University Bochum’s **Biopsychology Laboratory**, exploring fMRI & res-fMRI data using advanced machine learning techniques. These experiences enriched my expertise in deep learning applications for healthcare and computational neuroscience.

While maintaining a keen interest in **autonomous driving**, I have recently shifted my primary focus to **medical imaging**. Motivated by the transformative potential of **machine learning** in **healthcare**, I leverage my strong foundation in **deep learning** and **computer vision** to contribute to this field. Over the past year, I have been honing my expertise in this field, combining creativity with a passion for solving complex challenges. My dedication to research, combined with my collaborative mindset and interdisciplinary background, allows me to bring both technical depth and innovative problem-solving to impactful research projects.
