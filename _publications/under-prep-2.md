## Abstract

Heart sound recordings, or phonocardiograms (PCGs), play a vital role in the early detection of cardiovascular disorders. However, achieving reliable and accurate PCG classification remains challenging due to noise contamination, inter-subject variability, and the limited availability of labeled data in real-world conditions. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired variational convolutional network (QiVC-Net), which integrates probabilistic reasoning, temporal symmetry, and structured uncertainty modeling for robust PCG classification. The key innovation of QiVC-Net lies in the quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) sampling mechanism, which adjusts network weights through differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations inspired by quantum state evolution. This mechanism preserves the intrinsic structure of the parameter space while introducing uncertainty in a controlled manner, leading to more expressive and well-calibrated representations. The proposed framework adopts a lightweight architecture combined with a physiologically informed preprocessing pipeline, enhancing robustness to recording variability without increasing computational cost or overfitting risk. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on two benchmark datasets: the PhysioNet computing in cardiology 2016 (CinC) and the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022 (CirCor) datasets. QiVC-Net achieved state-of-the-art results, obtaining 97.84 accuracy on CinC, and 97.89 accuracy on CirCor. These results demonstrate the model’s capability to deliver reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions across heterogeneous recording conditions, highlighting its potential for clinical decision support in cardiac sound analysis.
