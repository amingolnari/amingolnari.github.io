## Abstract

Accurate and uncertainty-aware classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals is essential for the early detection of cardiovascular abnormalities. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired variational convolutional network that concurrently captures temporal dependencies and models predictive uncertainty. The architecture features a bidirectional variational convolutional design, where forward and backward kernels are independently sampled using a stochastic mechanism termed quantum-inspired rotated ensembles. This technique injects structured perturbations into the variational space via random subspace rotations, drawing inspiration from quantum amplitude encoding and unitary transformations. As a result, the method enhances the geometric expressiveness of the posterior distribution without introducing additional learnable parameters. When evaluated on the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 heart sound classification dataset, the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 97.7%, outperforming existing baselines while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. The framework offers a compact, interpretable, and robust solution for PCG-based diagnosis in safety-critical clinical applications.
