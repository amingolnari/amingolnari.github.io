## Abstract

Biometric recognition is a popular topic in machine vision. Deep Neural Networks have been recently used in several applications, especially in biometric recognition. In this paper, we combine a Deep Neural Network alongside Augmented Reality to produce a system capable of recognizing the faces of individuals and displaying some information about the individual as an Augmented Reality. We used a dataset containing 1200 face images of 100 faculty members of the Shahrood University of Technology. After training the proposed Deep Network, it reached the recognition accuracy of 99.45%. We also provided some graphical targets for each person that contains his information. When a person is identified by the deep network, the target image provided for augmented reality is aligned with the angle and dimensions of the detected face and displayed on top of it.
